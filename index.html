            The current world population is more than 7.6 billion people. <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html">The United Nations estimates that the world population will reach 9.2 billion by 2050</a>.
            That’s more than seven billion three hundred million bodies that need to be fed, clothed, kept warm and ideally, nurtured and educated. More than 7.3 billion individuals who, while busy consuming resources, are also producing vast
            quantities of waste, and our numbers continue to grow.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many people worry that population growth will eventually cause an environmental
            catastrophe. However, there are many factors at play. Essentially, it is what is happening within those populations—their <a href="#urban">distribution</a>
            and their <a href="#consum">consumption patterns</a> —that are of equal, if not more importance, than
            just numbers.

          <h2>Urbanization</h2>

          <p>
            In 1960 less than one third of the world’s population lived in cities.
            By 2014, that figure was 54 percent, with a projected rise to 66 percent by 2050.
            <br />
                  People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than residents in rural areas. Some believe urban populations consume much more food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. You'd think so,
                  especially
                  looking at nighttime satellite photos that show dark landscapes illuminated by glowing urban dots. On the surface, these seem like clear evidence of city dwellers' oversized energy footprints. However, the opposite may be true.

                  According to <u>EIA data</u>, urban U.S. households own an average of 1.8 vehicles each, compared with 2.2 for each rural household. Urban families also drive
                  about
                  7,000 fewer miles annually than their rural counterparts, saving more than 400 gallons of gasoline and roughly $1,300-$1,400 at current gas prices.

                all four categories. Rural areas consume about 95 million Btu per household each year, followed by towns (102 million) and suburbs (109 million).

            It is the unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, primarily in developed nations, that are of greater concern. Since the 1800s and the Industrial Revolution the world has been consuming at a higher rate than ever. The
            Revolution allowed products to be available in enormous quantities for the first time in history.

            Several indicators of consumption have grown at rates well above population growth in the past century: Global GDP is 20 times higher than it was in 1900, having grown at a rate of 2.7% per annum; CO2 emissions have grown
            at an annual rate of 3.5% since 1900, reaching an all-time high of 100 million metric tons of carbon in 2001; and the ecological footprint, a composite measure of consumption measured in hectares of biologically productive
            land, grew from 4.5 to 14.1 billion hectares between 1961 and 2003, and it is now 25% more than Earth’s “biocapacity” according to <a href="https://www.wwf.or.jp/activities/data/WWF_LPR_2014.pdf">WWF's Living Plant Report</a>. In the
            case of CO2 emissions and
            footprints, the per capita impacts of high-income
            countries are currently 6 to 10 times higher than those in low-income countries. As far as the future is concerned, there is no reason to suspect that consumption trends will change significantly in the near term.
