            The current world population is more than 7.6 billion people. <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html">The United Nations estimates that the world population will reach 9.2 billion by 2050</a>.
            That’s more than seven billion three hundred million bodies that need to be fed, clothed, kept warm and ideally, nurtured and educated. More than 7.3 billion individuals who, while busy consuming resources, are also producing vast
            quantities of waste, and our numbers continue to grow.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many people worry that population growth will eventually cause an environmental
            catastrophe. However, there are many factors at play. Essentially, it is what is happening within those populations—their <a href="#urban">distribution</a>
            and their <a href="#consum">consumption patterns</a> —that are of equal, if not more importance, than
            just numbers.

          <h2>Urbanization</h2>

          <p>
            In 1960 less than one third of the world’s population lived in cities.
            By 2014, that figure was 54 percent, with a projected rise to 66 percent by 2050.
            <br />
            <br />
            People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than residents in rural areas. Urban populations consume much more food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. For example, urban populations have many more cars than rural populations per capita, according to the
            <a href="https://www.prb.org/urbanization-an-environmental-force-to-be-reckoned-with/">Population Reference Bureau</a>. The pressure placed on cities and their resources due to continuing growth includes pollution from additional cars,
            heaters, and other modern luxuries, which can cause a range of localized environmental problems. Gases and particles are released the air, such as from car tailpipes, building heat sources, and power plants, decreasing the air quality of
            these cities.

              <h2>Consumption</h2>
              <p>
                It is the unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, primarily in developed nations, that are of even greater concern.
                <br />
                <br />
            Several indicators of consumption have grown at rates well above population growth in the past century: Global GDP is 20 times higher than it was in 1900, having grown at a rate of 2.7% per annum; CO2 emissions have grown
            at an annual rate of 3.5% since 1900, reaching an all-time high of 100 million metric tons of carbon in 2001; and the ecological footprint, a composite measure of consumption measured in hectares of biologically productive
            land, grew from 4.5 to 14.1 billion hectares between 1961 and 2003, and it is now 25% more than Earth’s “biocapacity” according to <a href="https://www.wwf.or.jp/activities/data/WWF_LPR_2014.pdf">WWF's Living Plant Report</a>. In the
                case of CO2 emissions and
                footprints, the per capita impacts of high-income
                countries are currently 6 to 10 times higher than those in low-income countries. As far as the future is concerned, there is no reason to suspect that consumption trends will change significantly in the near term.

                Less is more. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11031-013-9371-4">Studies have shown that more ‘stuff’ doesn't make people happier anyway</a>. We need to step back and re-examine what is important and actively
                find
                ways to reduce the amount of resources we consume. Taking shorter showers, saying no to single-use plastics, buying less, recycling our waste and reviewing our mode and frequency of travel may seem trivial, but if millions around the
                world begin to do it as well, the difference will begin to add up.
